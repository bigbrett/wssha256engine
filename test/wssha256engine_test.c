  // BRIEF: Specify the path to our shared library engine, set the ID, and load it.
  // 
  // The "SO_PATH" control command should be used to identify the
  // shared-library that contains the ENGINE implementation, and "NO_VCHECK"
  // might possibly be useful if there is a minor version conflict and you
  // (or a vendor helpdesk) is convinced you can safely ignore it.
  // "ID" is probably only needed if a shared-library implements
  // multiple ENGINEs, but if you know the engine id you expect to be using,
  // it doesn't hurt to specify it (and this provides a sanity check if
  // nothing else). "LIST_ADD" is only required if you actually wish the
  // loaded ENGINE to be discoverable by application code later on using the
  // ENGINE's "id". For most applications, this isn't necessary - but some
  // application authors may have nifty reasons for using it
  // The "LOAD" command is the only one that takes no parameters and is the command
  // that uses the settings from any previous commands to actually *load*
  // the shared-library ENGINE implementation. If this command succeeds, the
  // (copy of the) 'dynamic' ENGINE will magically morph into the ENGINE
  // that has been loaded from the shared-library. As such, any control
  // commands supported by the loaded ENGINE could then be executed as per
  // normal. Eg. if ENGINE "foo" is implemented in the shared-library
  // "libfoo.so" and it supports some special control command "CMD_FOO", the
  // following code would load and use it (NB: obviously this code has no error checking);
