# wssha256engine
A minimal openSSL engine for offloading sha256 functions to a hardware accelerator in FPGA logic

## Prerequisites
1. You are running linux on the Xilinx ZYNQ-7000 development board, with the necessary design instantiated in PL [link to final design goes here]
2. Ensure you have openSSL using the command `$ openssl version`. If you have lower than version 1.0.2, you must upgrade to this version.
3. Check out the repository using git `$ git clone https://github.com/bigbrett/wssha256engine.git` 

## Building the engine

    $ cd wssha256engine
    $ make

You can verify that the engine can be loaded using: 

    $ openssl engine -t -c `pwd`/bin/libwssha256engine.so
    (/home/brett/wssha256engine/bin/libwssha256engine.so) A test engine for the ws sha256 hardware encryption module, on the Xilinx ZYNQ7000
    Loaded: (wssha256engine) A test engine for the ws sha256 hardware encryption module, on the Xilinx ZYNQ7000
        [ available ]

**Note** You may get an error complaining that `ERROR: Digest is empty! (NID = 0)`. I'm investigating the cause of this, however the engine still loads properly and it does not seem to affect the functionality of the test program 

## Testing the engine
A **quick and easy** test goes like this, where the resultant digest values should be identical: 

(**Note:** the engine does not yet support variable length message data. As such, the test below will only work for 256-byte messages. Internally, the message is not truncated to the nearest 64-byte block, but instead an entire 256-byte block is hashed, with bytes after the end of data padded with zeros. Therefore, a message shorter than 256 bytes will currently hash incorrectly: [see here](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/46996/openssl-sha1-message-digest-not-matching-with-nist-vector-input))

    $ teststr="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec vel nulla malesuada, dictum diam ut, semper sapien. Etiam faucibus porttitor tristique. Vestibulum id magna sed velit ornare varius vitae nec erat. Mauris dui arcu, pulvinar eu pretium posuere."
    
    $ echo $teststr | openssl dgst -engine /full/path/to/libwssha256engine.so -sha256
      (stdin)= 28ed684090a0df4a70fd2ac9249a5cb13ddda6f34055148b739cd3b668445cf9
    
    $ echo $teststr | openssl dgst -sha256
      (stdin)= 28ed684090a0df4a70fd2ac9249a5cb13ddda6f34055148b739cd3b668445cf9

A **more advanced** test, using a c test program, can be conducted like this (see test/wssha256engine_test.c for implementation): 
    
    $ make test
    $ source test/runtest.sh

NOTE: the runtest.sh script must remain in the test directory, but should be able to be called from anywhere
